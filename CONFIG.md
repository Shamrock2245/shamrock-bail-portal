# CONFIG.md

## Overview
This document defines configurable business rules for Shamrock Bail Bonds Portal.  
These values control fees, collateral requirements, counties served, and check-in frequency.

---

## Counties Served
- **Primary Counties**: Lee, Charlotte, Collier.  
- **All Other Counties**: Licensed to post in **all 65 counties in Florida**, but transfer fees vary by agent availability.  

### Transfer Fees
- **Outside Lee County**: $100 base transfer fee.  
- **Other Counties**: Additional fees may apply, pending a quote from the local bondsman.  

---

## Bond Fees
- **State Mandated**: 10% of face value of the bail, or $100 per charge, whichever is greater.  
- **Example**:  
  - Charge 1 = $500  
  - Charge 2 = $10,000  
  - Total bail = $10,500  
  - Fee = $1,100 (because of $100 minimum on the $500 charge).  

---

## Collateral Rules
- **Standard Cases (< $50k)**: Usually signatures only (99% of bonds).  
- **Large Bonds (≥ $50k)**: Collateral required. A homeowner or property owner must sign as indemnitor.  
- **Collateral Types**: Real estate, vehicles, cash — but primarily signatures unless high-value case.  

---

## Check-Ins
- **Frequency**: Once per week, on **Wednesday**.  
- **Exceptions**: Alternate schedule may be arranged with Shamrock Bail Bonds staff.  
- **Certified Check-In** includes:
  - Selfie photo
  - GPS location
  - Device fingerprint

---

## Payment Plans
- Defendants/indemnitors on payment plans must follow the agreed terms.  
- **Violation** of payment plan = **violation of bond**.  

---

## Notes
- All fees and rules align with Florida state requirements.  
- Updates to county transfer fees should be reflected in both **Staff Console settings** and **Client Portal FAQs**.  
- Collateral thresholds and check-in policies may be adjusted as business rules evolve.
