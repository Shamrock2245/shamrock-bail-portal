# Shamrock Bail Bonds Portal (Wix + External API)

This project is the official Shamrock Bail Bonds Portal. It runs on Wix (Velo + Members Area) for the client-facing front end, and connects to an external API backend (Node/FastAPI) for secure workflows (PDF rendering, signatures, payments, check-ins).

‚∏ª

## üìå Goals
	‚Ä¢	Automate all bail bond paperwork (Financial Indemnity, Appearance Application, Collateral/Promissory Note, Bond Info Sheet, Waivers, SSA-3288, Credit Card Authorization).
	‚Ä¢	Minimize repetitive data entry with shared schemas.
	‚Ä¢	Enable role-based portals:
	‚Ä¢	Defendant: application, waivers, check-in, optional payment.
	‚Ä¢	Indemnitor/Cosignor: financials, indemnity, collateral, payment.
	‚Ä¢	Staff: dashboard for prefill, tracking, case management.
	‚Ä¢	Collect legally valid e-signatures with audit trails.
	‚Ä¢	Support payments via Wix Payments (Stripe/PayPal).
	‚Ä¢	Allow GPS + selfie check-ins for defendants with certified audit.
	‚Ä¢	Export court-ready PDFs that mirror official packet forms.

‚∏ª

## üõ† Tech Stack
	‚Ä¢	Front End: Wix + Velo (JS), Members Area, Forms, Camera/GPS APIs.
	‚Ä¢	Backend API: Node.js or Python (FastAPI) with OpenAPI 3.1 spec.
	‚Ä¢	Database: Encrypted PII store (e.g., Postgres + KMS).
	‚Ä¢	Storage: Secure blob for PDFs, selfies, signatures.
	‚Ä¢	Payments: Wix Payments / Stripe.
	‚Ä¢	Deployment: GitHub integration with Wix; external API hosted (Vercel/Render/AWS).

‚∏ª

## üîê Security & Compliance
	‚Ä¢	PII encrypted at rest, TLS in transit.
	‚Ä¢	PCI DSS compliance (never store raw PAN/CVV).
	‚Ä¢	JWT auth for staff; magic links/OTP for clients.
	‚Ä¢	Audit logs for all signatures, payments, check-ins.

## üîó API Endpoints

See API_SPEC.md for full OpenAPI 3.1 definitions.
Key endpoints:
	‚Ä¢	POST /persons
	‚Ä¢	POST /cases
	‚Ä¢	POST /documents
	‚Ä¢	POST /signatures/requests
	‚Ä¢	POST /payments/authorize
	‚Ä¢	POST /checkins

‚∏ª

## üìÑ Documents & Schemas

All forms are digitized via JSON Schema (Draft 2020-12).
See SCHEMAS.md for definitions and conditionals.
Examples:
	‚Ä¢	financial_indemnity_v1
	‚Ä¢	appearance_application_v1
	‚Ä¢	collateral_promissory_v1
	‚Ä¢	bond_info_sheet_v1
	‚Ä¢	waiver_authorization_v1
	‚Ä¢	ssa_3288_v1
	‚Ä¢	cc_authorization_v1

## üì¶ Setup
	1.	Wix Side
	‚Ä¢	Connect Wix to this repo via GitHub integration.
	‚Ä¢	Enable Velo developer mode.
	‚Ä¢	Add Members Area for login.
	‚Ä¢	Configure Wix Payments.
	‚Ä¢	Create Velo data collections for Persons, Cases, Docs, Check-Ins.
	2.	API Side
	‚Ä¢	Deploy backend (api/) separately.
	‚Ä¢	Import shamrock_openapi.yaml into Postman/Swagger.
	‚Ä¢	Configure environment variables (DB_URL, STRIPE_KEY, JWT_SECRET).
	3.	Integration
	‚Ä¢	Velo fetch calls to /api/v1/... endpoints.
	‚Ä¢	Validate form inputs against schemas before submission.
	‚Ä¢	Store PDF/selfie/signature blobs via backend.

‚∏ª

## ü§ñ For AI Builders (Manus, Copilot, etc.)
	‚Ä¢	Stay Wix-aware: all UI code = Velo JS. Use wix-users, wix-data, wix-fetch, wix-pay.
	‚Ä¢	Backend = external API: never embed heavy logic in Wix, call /api/v1.
	‚Ä¢	Render PDFs externally: match uploaded packet layout.
	‚Ä¢	Respect schemas: see SCHEMAS.md.
	‚Ä¢	Follow security rules above.

## Additional Markdown Files

**API_SPEC.md**
	‚Ä¢	Embed the OpenAPI 3.1 YAML (shamrock_openapi.yaml).
	‚Ä¢	Summarize endpoints with example requests/responses.
	‚Ä¢	Helps Manus wire frontend ‚Üí backend cleanly.

**SCHEMAS.md**
	‚Ä¢	Contain all JSON Schemas (Person, Case, Documents).
	‚Ä¢	List conditionals (e.g., real estate requires deed upload).
	‚Ä¢	Helps Manus auto-generate validation logic.

**PDF_TEMPLATES.md**
	‚Ä¢	Describe page-by-page packet anchors for signature fields and inputs.
	‚Ä¢	E.g., Page 1: ‚ÄúNAME OF INDEMNITOR‚Äù at x=120, y=640.
	‚Ä¢	Guides Manus when wiring form ‚Üí PDF render.

**MANUS.md**
	‚Ä¢	A stripped-down copy of your ‚Äúmaster prompt‚Äù (the one we built earlier).
	‚Ä¢	Makes it explicit what Manus should always optimize for.
